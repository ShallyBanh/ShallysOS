# ShallysOS
A simple operating system built following the guides of:

* http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf
* https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial

## Inspiration
Because why not. OS's are sooo cool. I feel like as a student you learn so much about theory in school but you never get the opportunity to apply your knowledge so I thought "Hey, I just took a course on Operating Systems why not build an OS?"

## Building and Running ShallysOs

The tools use to build ShallysOS are:
* gcc
* gmp
* mpfr
* libmpc
* nasm
* qemu

To run just run
> qemu-system-i386 os-image.bin

and ShallysOS should boot up
